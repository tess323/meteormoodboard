# ${1:Moodboard}
A one page, mobile-friendly app used to spark inspiration through the generation of moodboards based on user input.

## Technologies Used
Moodboard is built and deployed in Meteor using React, JSX, JQuery, HTML and CSS.  It makes calls to the Unsplash API and utilized xcode for mobile IOS deployment.

## Approach 
My goal with this project was to practice React and gain more comfort with Meteor.  Since I was making calls to a photo API, I began by wire-framing very minimalistic mobile-first designs.  I built out a very basic Meteor App and tested its functionality.  From there I built out the React heavy moodboard component, starting with a single photo and finishing by designing the current grid.  From there I implimented in page scrolling and worked to build out an intuitive and cohesive design.
