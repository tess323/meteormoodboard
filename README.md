## Moodboard
A one page app used to spark inspiration through the generation of moodboards based on user input.  It can be found at <a href= "my-moodboard.meteor.com">my-moodboard.meteor.com</a>


## Technologies Used
 - Meteor
 - React
 - JSX
 - JQuery
 - HTML 
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap
 - Unsplay API
 - Xcode (ionic version in development) 

## Approach 
My goal with this project was to practice React and gain more comfort with Meteor.  Since I was making calls to a photo API, I began by wire-framing very minimalistic mobile-first designs.  I built out a very basic Meteor App and tested its functionality.  From there I built out the React heavy moodboard component, starting with a single photo and finishing by designing the current grid.  From there I implimented in page scrolling and worked to build out an intuitive and cohesive design.



## Known Issues
- Time did not allow for TDD, I hope to retroactively write tests for this project
- Board requires a double click for reload
